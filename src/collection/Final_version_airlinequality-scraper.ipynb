This is chosen as reviews are very rarely changed thus having historical data might be less relevant. Normally the csv.writer writes \\r\\n into the file directly. However, on windows it will write \\r\\r\\n because on Windows text mode each \\n will be translated into \\r\\n. Therefore we override the newlines with the parameter newline='' (empty string).

This comfirms that the function was able to be executed without a problem. The csv file gets automatically stored in the data folder of this directory. This is because \"../../data/\" was added as a string to the file name. In addition, the airline name gets automatically added to the file name because the second parameter of the function is transformed to a string. We have manually added the date of when the data of KLM has been scraped to the csv file name. We gathered this date and time from the scrape function as this is printed when the function is executed (see paragraph 2.3).   "
