# 1.1 Motivation 
## *Motivation for data context*
According to research of the European.ce (2020) 1,034 million Europeans travelled by plane. This is an increase of 3.8% compared with 2018. Corona has shut down the aircraft industry for a while, but the industry is currently getting back on track.  Because this market has so many customers, there are also many suppliers. It is estimated that there are around 5.000-5.500 airlines across the world, of which there are 700-800 commercial airlines operating scheduled flights globally.
According to research airlines have to focus on customer satisfaction and customer experience to differentiate itself from other competitors in this market (Ban & Kim, 2019). Studies have shown that analysing online review data has several advantages for the customers’ satisfaction and the way the customers experience the airlines. These advantages are:
•	It is an inexpensive way to gather information as reviews are often already available on websites or apps (Liau & Tan, 2014).  
•	Reviews from customers are considered as trustworthy (Brochado et. Al, 2019).
•	Reviews are fast, which means that reviews are often put online within days of a customer's "purchase" (Brochado et. Al, 2019).
These advantages show that gaining data from reviews of customers can be an interesting way to analyse and improve customer satisfaction. However, there is no dataset available where airlines can analyse all reviews of their airline. Analysing reviews from website is extremely time consuming because little to no filters can be applied and therefore it is very difficult to make segments. Scraping the reviews from a website to make a dataset, can therefore be very useful for airlines. 
 
## *Motivation for website*
There are plenty of websites on the internet where reviews of airlines are collected. Several websites have been analysed and the website airlinequality.com has been chosen as the best option for scraping because of the following reasons:
•	Airlinequality.com gives customers the opportunity to verify their flight though by uploading their boading pass or ticket. Airlines can therefore be sure that the verified reviews are written by people who have actually used the airline. As a result, the dataset contains more credible data.
•	Airlinequality.com lets customers rate the airline on several different variables which already have been mentioned above. This gives the airline star ratings on various variables which gives the airline insight into its good and bad points.
•	Airlinequality.com is an international website, which means that it can get reviews from customers of all countries. 
The websites that have been analysed besides airlinequality.com are mentioned below and it is given why these website will not be used to scrape reviews.
•	Tripadvisor.com. This website lets the customer rates on different variables but does not give verified reviews, which means that the website does not check whether the customer has actually been on the flight he is reviewing. This allows people to write fake reviews, this reduces the reliability of the dataset.
•	Flight.report.com. This website lets customer also rate on different variables but each review is published on a separate page. When scraping these reviews, each page should be scraped individually to get all the reviews. This is extremely time consuming and therefore these website has not been chosen to scrape.

# 1.2 Composition
## *Entities, linkages, timeframe and algorithmic biases*
The data scraped in this report will give assess to insides about KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer  reviews places on the website airlinequality.com. The scraping code that has been used to scrape the data from KLM’s page can also be used to scrape data from other airlines. After scarping the reviews of KLM, a dataset has been made of the information that has been scraped.

The rating can contain of a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being the lowest score and 5 being the highest score. Since these ratings were not a mandatory item of the review, there are missings for each of these columns. The total of missings per column are given below:

    o	Column 14: 31 missings
    o	Column 15: 72 missings

# 1.3 Collection process

## *Technical extraction plan*
The website that is scraped is, as stated before, www.airlinequality.com. This is a website and therefore we could either use BeautifulSoup or selenium in order to scrape data from the website. We decide to use BeautifulSoup for scraping. The reason that we decided to do this is mainly because we do not need the Java elements of www.airlinequality.com in order to properly scrape the website. Also, since www.airlinequality.com show all the reviews instantly without the need for scrolling throughout the page. Furthermore, all the elements that we want to scrape from www.airlinequality.com are HTML-elements. Therefore, BeautifulSoup works perfectly for scraping www.airlinequality.com. 
There are multiple entities that are scraped from www.airlinequality.com. First, in order to scrape all the reviews for one airline during COVID-19, we had to determine which pages of reviews considered the COVID-19 period. We used June 1, 2018 as the starting date. We included all the reviews up to 2021-10-12 20:57. At KLM, this means that we scraped the first 40 pages of reviews. The number of pages depends on the airline, but can be based on the dates provided above. Second, we also determined to scrape multiple airlines. The airlines can be manually chosen from the 
In order to scrape www.airlinequality.com, there are a few steps that a potential researcher needs to do manually. First, select the airline that is of interest. Airine quality provides a list of airlines from A to Z where you can select the airline or airlines that you are interested in. Second, select the period that should be investigated. Based on this period, the researcher needs to determine the number of pages that covers this period and this number of pages should be implemented in the code. 

The data set, as stated above, is scraped based on the COVID-19 period. Therefore, June 1, 2018 was used as the starting date. The data set is finalized on 2021-10-12 20:57. Therefore, no reviews that are submitted after this data are visible in the dataset. The final data set is stored in the (repository) [https://github.com/dogabayraktar/COVID19-Infection-on-Airline-Reviews/tree/main/data]  

## *Legal and ethical concerns*
There are no legal and ethical concerns when scraping this data. The people that are submitting their reviews on this website know that their information is visible. Furthermore, the collected data is, besides the name where they can indicate whether they want to use their own name, fully anonymous.

## *Accessibility and structure of final data files*


# 1.5 Uses 

The dataset obtained after scraping the website airlinequality.com is mainly made for airlines. As already described in the motivation, it is very valuable for airlines to observe reviews to enhance the customer experience of a customer. This dataset is valuable because it saves valuable time because all information is contained in one data file. This allows marketers to easily create segments and find out what the wishes and needs of these segments are.
